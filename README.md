# 📊 E-Commerce Analytics Data Engineering Project
## 🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline built on an e-commerce dataset, covering data ingestion, transformation, modeling, and analytics. The goal is to transform raw operational data into analytics-ready tables that support business insights such as revenue growth, marketing performance, and customer behavior.

The dataset simulates real-world e-commerce operations, including website traffic, user sessions, orders, products, and refunds, making it ideal for practicing modern data engineering workflows.
